# flasktube
This is my very first attempt to write a web-site. It's very straightforward and unprofessional but, still, it works to some extent.
All of the code (except some small-scale parts found in the public domain) was written by me. Writing this project, I learned some SQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS apart from Python and Flask.
As I consider now, there are numerous ways of improving and expanding this project.

To run this project on your local machine, you may use Docker with 
```bash
'make build'  
'make run'  
```

To login as admin use

email = admin@admin.com
login = admin

and you'll have access to 'localhost/admin' route
